 Estimated Task Time: 1 - 3 hours.

In this Task, you’ll create additional pages for your portfolio site using the recommended structure discussed in the Exercise. Remember that you can always preview your site by double-clicking your HTML file from a file explorer and opening it directly in your default browser.

**Directions**

1.  Create a folder structure for your website:
    
    *   The structure should include a folder for your images and the upcoming CSS files.
    *   Rename your HTML file from the previous Exercise to “index.html”.
2.  Add additional HTML pages to the new folder.
    
    *   Create a “contact.html” page.
    *   Create an “about.html” page.
3.  Build a header with a logo and a set of navigation links, then copy-paste it in all your files.
    
    *   Add the HTML5 `<header></header>` element to “index.html” and add your logo and navigation inside it.
    *   Create a navigation using the HTML5 tag `<nav></nav>` inside the header and copy the whole header over to the contact and about pages.
4.  Add contact information to your contact page.
    
    *   Add a linked email address.
    *   Add a linked telephone number or voice/video chat contact information.
    *   Add a call-to-action link.
5.  Update your footer.
    
    *   Add SVG icons for your “Find me on” section in the footer.
    *   Replace the div tags with HTML5 `<footer>` tags.
6.  Once you’re happy with your code, save it and create a zip file of all the folders within your new website’s file structure.
    
7.  Upload your zip file here. Feel free to share additional thoughts or ask questions on your submission page.
    

> _Note!_  
> Make sure all your HTML files are properly indented!

**Bonus Task:**

Looking for additional practice with forms? Create a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) with a contact form. Save the CodePen and add the link to your submission. You’ll be able to add the contact form to your portfolio page after Achievement 3, once you’ve learned about server-side programming.
